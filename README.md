# Project ZooFunctions

Hello! Welcome to my Zoo Functions project repository. In this project, you will be tasked with organizing zoo information, developing functions to search for information about species and animals, as well as the people involved in collaborating and maintaining the zoo. In addition, you will have the opportunity to apply test-driven development (TDD) to ensure code quality.

## Mandatory Requirements Developed

1. I implemented the `getSpeciesByIds` function to search for animal species by means of an ID and return an array containing all animals of that species.

2. I implemented the `getAnimalsOlderThan` function that takes a species and an age as a parameter and checks if all animals of that species have the informed age or are older.

3. Implemented the `getEmployeeByName` function to search for collaborators by their first or last name.

4. I implemented the `getRelatedEmployees` function to check if a collaborator person is a manager and which people he leads.

5. Implemented the `countAnimals` function to count the amount of animal species residing in the zoo.

6. I got at least 80% test coverage on the `handlerElephants` function.

7. I got at least 90% test coverage on the `handlerElephants` function.

8. Implemented the `calculateEntry` function to calculate the total entry value of zoo visitors.

9. I implemented the `getSchedule` function to provide a schedule with the available visit times of the week for each species of animal.

10. Implemented the `getOldestFromFirstSpecies` function to find the oldest animal of the species managed by a collaborating person.

11. I implemented the `getEmployeesCoverage` function to return information about the collaborating person and the species for which he is responsible.

12. I got at least 85% test coverage on the `getOpeningHours` function.

13. I got at least 95% test coverage on the `getOpeningHours` function.

14. Implemented the `getAnimalMap` function to geographically map the animals of each species and perform location filters, name in alphabetical order and sex.

Bonus Requirements

15. Got 100% test coverage on the `handlerElephants` function.

16. Got at least 100% test coverage in the `getOpeningHours` function.

Thanks for checking out my Zoo Functions project. Now the zoo information is organized and you can search for data about the species, the animals and the people involved. In addition, the application makes use of tests to ensure the quality of the code. Feel free to explore the project, and if you have any questions or need help, I'm here to help.
